# Wallpaper_Texture_Generation

Introduction

Textures contain a wealth of image information and are widely used in various fields such as computer graphics and computer vision.We proposes to describe wallpaper texture images by using multi-label semantics. Based on these labels and generative adversarial networks, we present a framework for perception driven wallpaper texture generation and style transfer. In this framework, a perceptual model is trained to recognize whether the wallpapers produced by the generator network are sufficiently realistic and have the attribute designated by given perceptual description; these multi-label semantic attributes are treated as condition variables to generate wallpaper images.
